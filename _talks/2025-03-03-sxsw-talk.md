We know the students with higher confidence get higher grades. What’s that about? How do we boost student confidence? With the Confidence Playbook of course -- an online tool the Behavioral Science and R&D Teams built to help students unpack what’s happening with their confidence and practice talking back to their inner critic. We rolled it out to 250 students in the Spring of 2024 and found that those who completed the playbook developed higher confidence and earned higher grades than those who did not complete the playbook.
